Input: [5, 5, 0, 4, 1, 4, 5, 5, 3, 2] (Steps taken at each number jump to other number)


 Output: 2

Explanation: The first element is 5. 
            Using that, we can reach 5 steps. 
            So, reach the 5th index, which is 4. 
            From there, we can make 4 steps,
            which leads us to the end of the array.

start -> 5 -> 4 -> 2(end)
